How to connect via Ethernet



It might be tricky to connect via Ethernet for the first time. By default the DHCP client is disabled and the IP address is configured as static 192.168.1.1
After having flashed OpenWrt like described above, you can reach the OpenWrt via Ethernet by using the IP address 192.168.1.1
It is highly likely that the gateway (router) to which the Raspberry Pi is connected has the same IP of 192.168.1.1
In that case if possible change the gateway IP to something else, then try accessing using the default static IP address of 192.168.1.1 using SSH or HTTP. Once you have access to the OpenWrt you can set password and enable DHCP.

If it is not possible to resolve the IP conflict read further...

In order to set it up as a DHCP client, attach a serial console and do the following:

uci set network.lan.proto=dhcp
uci commit
/etc/init.d/network restart
Alternatively, in order to set it up with a fixed IP different from the default 192.168.1.1 do the following:

uci set network.lan.ipaddr=192.168.1.199
uci commit
/etc/init.d/network restart
Now you should be able to log in via telnet, SSH, or HTTP to set your password.
